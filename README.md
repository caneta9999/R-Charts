# R-Charts
![](./Charts/charts.gif) <br/>
Repository created to store charts made with the R language. <br/>
Some of the charts I wasn't familiar with, so I can't guarantee they're all accurate, but I enjoyed creating them. <br/>
The "gif.py" file was created to make the charts gif. <br/>
I was inspired by [Cheatsheet 70+ ggplot Charts ðŸ“Š](https://www.kaggle.com/code/akhabash/cheatsheet-70-ggplot-charts) <br/>
I was also helped by ChatGPT to help me with the charts and python script.
